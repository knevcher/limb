This packages provides advanced tools for running SimpleTest(http://www.lastcraft.com/simple_test.php)
based tests within the file system.

If you simply grabbed archive with this package without installing it via PEAR installer, most probably
you want to setup convenient script for running tests(PEAR installer makes it for you).

Here's how you can do that:

unit bash script(*nix):

  #/bin/bash
  php /path/to/tests_runner/bin/limb_unit.php $@

unit.bat(Windows)

  @echo off
  php /path/to/tests_runner/bin/limb_unit.php %*

Try running in you shell:

unit -h

If everything installed properly you should see a help message.

Some quick shell usage examples using this script:

  $ unit my_test.php      #running all test cases defined in my_test.php
  $ unit *_test.php       #running all test cases contained in *_test.php files
  $ unit tests            #running recursively all tests from test directory
  $ find -name tests -type d | xargs -i unit "{}" #running all tests from any directories called tests
